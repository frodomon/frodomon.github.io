    title: "How I Lead Design"
    description: >
      I have built my career wearing different “hats”: technology, data,
      product, design, and entrepreneurship. This combination allows me
      to approach complex problems with a systemic perspective.
    experience:

      highlights:
          - "Experience in fintech, services, and complex platforms"
          - "Technical background that bridges collaboration with engineering"
          - "Focused on decision-making, not just visual execution"
    principles:
      title: "Principles"
      items:
        - "Design is decision-making, not decoration"
        - "The right problem is worth more than the perfect solution"
        - "Scaling design requires systems, not heroes"
        - "Impact must be measured, not assumed"

  cases:  
    # Caso Janus (EN)
    janus:
      title: "Digital Mortgage Product (Janus)"
      context: "A financial product aimed at digitizing the end-to-end mortgage acquisition process under strict regulatory and technical restrictions."
      problem: "The team assumed the main issue was the number of steps, but the core pain point was complex financial terminology and lack of clarity before irreversible decisions."
      role: "As Design Lead, I defined clarity and information hierarchy criteria, aligned stakeholders across design, risk, legal, and tech, and guided architectural decisions."
      decisions:
        - "Prioritized clarity of critical information before action."
        - "Adaptive content based on user profile."
        - "Visual support to reduce cognitive load."
      results: "Shortened simulation flow and improved understanding, leading to early conversions post-launch."
      learnings: "Content design must be integrated earlier, especially in financial products."

    # Caso Otto (EN)
    otto:
      title: "Otto — Community-Centric Business Design"
      context: "Otto was a community-focused TCG (trading card game) shop designed as a service ecosystem, not just a product."
      problem: "Existing shops lacked accessibility and community experience; users needed belonging, not just transactions."
      role: "As founder and design lead, I defined value propositions, led user research, designed end-to-end service experiences, and aligned business and tech decisions."
      decisions:
        - "Created differentiated experiences for distinct user archetypes."
        - "Invested in comfortable physical spaces to enhance experience, prioritizing long-term value over short-term margin."
        - "Built digital community channels as part of the product."
      results: "Sustained growth in attendance and sales, high recurrency, strong community organic growth."
      learnings: "Design is behaviour-focused; community is a strategic asset; tech supports experience, not replaces it."
